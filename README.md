# Data Structures - Linked Lists

This repository contains implementations of linked list data structures in Python, specifically the **Singly Linked List** and **Doubly Linked List**.

## Files

- `SinglyLinkedList.py`: Contains the implementation of a singly linked list (SLL), where each node points to the next node in the sequence.
- `DoublyLinkedList.py`: Contains the implementation of a doubly linked list (DLL), where each node has pointers to both the next and previous nodes.

- `Stack.py`: Contains the implementation of a stack, which follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.


## Features

### Singly Linked List (SLL)
- **File**: `SinglyLinkedList.py`
- **Description**: Implements a singly linked list with basic operations: Insert at start pos, end pos and desired pos; Deletion at start pos, end pos and desried pos; Traversal .


### Doubly Linked List (DLL)
- **File**: `DoublyLinkedList.py`
- **Description**: Implements a doubly linked list with enhanced functionality, having following operations: Insert at start pos, end pos and desired pos; Deletion at start pos, end pos and desried pos; Traversal from both pos .

### Stack
- **File**: `Stack.py`
- **Description**: Implements a stack data structure with basic operations like `push`, `pop`, and `peek`. The stack operates on a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) basis.

## Usage

Clone the repository and run the files in a Python environment to interact with the linked list implementations. Each file contains methods to initialize, insert, delete, and traverse the lists.
